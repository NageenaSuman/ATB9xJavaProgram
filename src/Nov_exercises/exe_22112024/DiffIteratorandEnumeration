Iterator
An Iterator is a versatile tool in Java that allows you to traverse through
any type of collection, such as Set, List, Queue, Deque, and even classes implementing
the Map interface. It provides methods to read and remove elements from a collection during iteration.


Enumeration
Enumeration is an older interface used for traversing legacy collections such as Vector
and Hashtable. It allows you to read elements from these collections but does not support
modifications.
