Abstraction	Encapsulation

Abstraction is process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality
to the users.
Encapsulation is a process of binding data and methods together in a single unit,
providing controlled access to data.

In abstraction, problems are solved at the design or interface level.
While in encapsulation, problems are solved at the implementation level.

We can implement abstraction using abstract class and interfaces.
Whereas encapsulation can be implemented using by access modifier i.e. private, protected and
public and nested classes.
